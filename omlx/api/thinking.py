"""
Thinking/reasoning content parser for separating <think>...</think> blocks.

Provides both streaming (ThinkingParser) and non-streaming (extract_thinking)
interfaces for separating reasoning content from regular response content.

Used by reasoning models like DeepSeek R1, Qwen3/3.5, MiniMax that wrap
their chain-of-thought reasoning in <think>...</think> tags.
